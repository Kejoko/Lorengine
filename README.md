# Lorengine
A highly detailed and sophisticated world and lore generator.

Lorengine is a world and lore generator inspired by Dwarf Fortress but with many unique and different elements and features.
Lorengine will create a highly detailed and immersive world populated with people, places, and events.
Upon generation Lorengine will create a Wiki style document allowing for easy perusing through all of the world's elements.
A map will be created allowing for visualization of the world.


## Build Instructions

2. Clone the repository to your machine (a guide may be found [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)).
3. Open a terminal/command prompt (or your preferred shell) at the Lorengine folder.
4. Type "cmake ." into the your shell and hit enter.
5. Type "make" into your shell and hit enter.
6. All done! An executable, Lorengine, and a static library, lore_lib.a, should now be created.
